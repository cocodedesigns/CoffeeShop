                <p>Welcome, traveler! Whether you found us by chance, prophecy, or a well-placed Google search, we’re glad you’re here.</p>
                <p>Founded in Year One Post Brew (well, 2025), <strong>The Cozy Crit</strong> has been serving the good people of Greater Manchester with strong coffee, flaky pastries, and even stronger dice rolls ever since. We’re an independent café with a love for hot drinks, fresh bakes, and nerdy things — especially the kind that involve character sheets, chaotic alignments, and shouting "NAT 20!" loud enough to scare the barista.</p>
                
                <h2>So, what is The Cozy Crit?</h2>
                
                <p>At our core, we’re a **welcoming neighborhood coffee shop** with a bit of a nerdy streak. You’ll find all the staples of a great café here — expertly brewed coffees, artisan teas, iced drinks, and our ever-changing lineup of freshly baked pastries and cakes (including options for various dietary needs, because adventurers come in all forms). We believe good food and good drinks should feel like a warm hug — or at least a +2 bonus to morale.</p>
                <p>But what makes The Cozy Crit a little different is our love for **tabletop games and storytelling**. Whether you’re into board games, roleplaying, miniatures, or just the vibe of it all, we’ve carved out a cozy corner where games can be played, friendships formed, and campaigns launched.</p>

                <h2>Events, Games & Gatherings</h2>
                
                <p>We host **fortnightly Dungeons & Dragons sessions**, perfect for new and returning players alike. These aren’t just games — they’re communal storytelling experiences powered by coffee, camaraderie, and a shared love of rolling dice.</p>
                
                <p>Want to sharpen your DM skills? Curious how to roleplay a bard without bursting into song every ten minutes (or *with* it, we don’t judge)? Join our **weekly D&D workshops**, where we cover everything from world-building to combat rules to how not to get eaten by a gelatinous cube in your first session.</p>
                
                <p>We also run regular **board game nights**, casual meetups, and special themed events — so keep an eye on our calendar, or better yet, sign up for our newsletter and let us send the quests directly to your inbox.</p>
                
                <h2>Community Comes First</h2>

                <p>We’re more than a business — we’re a gathering place. A friendly inn at the edge of the modern world where people come to **relax, recharge, and reconnect**. Whether you’re here to sip a chai latte in peace, finish your novel, battle a band of goblins, or just meet new folks who love what you love, you’re always welcome.</p>
                
                <p>Our team is small, mighty, and passionate — about coffee, creativity, and creating a space that feels like home (with better lighting and significantly fewer tavern brawls).</p>
                
                <p>So grab a seat, roll for perception, and take in the vibe. At **The Cozy Crit**, there’s always a warm drink waiting and a new adventure just around the corner.</p>
                
                <p>See you soon, brave adventurer.</p>
